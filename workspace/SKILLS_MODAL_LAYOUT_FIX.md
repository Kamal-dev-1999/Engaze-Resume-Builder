# Skills Modal Layout Displacement Fix

## Problem
When opening the Skills Modal to add/manage skills, the entire layout was shifting and misaligning. The resume preview and editor sections were being displaced.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Modal not isolated from parent DOM flow** - Modal was rendering inside the editor div, causing layout shifts
2. **Sticky positioning conflicts** - The editor panel had `sticky top-6` which conflicted with modal positioning
3. **Overflow issues** - Container overflow wasn't properly managed when modal opened
4. **Body scroll management** - Background scrolling wasn't properly prevented

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. **SkillsModal.tsx** - Portal-Based Rendering
**Change:** Implemented React Portal using `ReactDOM.createPortal`

```tsx
// BEFORE: Modal rendered inline in component tree
<div className="fixed...">
  {/* modal content */}
</div>

// AFTER: Modal rendered at document root level
return ReactDOM.createPortal(modalContent, document.body);
```

**Benefits:**
- Modal renders outside the editor's DOM hierarchy
- No interference with parent's overflow/positioning
- Clean z-index stacking
- Modal stays fixed regardless of parent scrolling

### 2. **SkillsModal.tsx** - Body Scroll Prevention
```tsx
React.useEffect(() => {
  if (isOpen) {
    document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden';
    return () => {
      document.body.style.overflow = 'unset';
    };
  }
}, [isOpen]);
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents background from scrolling when modal is open
- Automatic cleanup on unmount

### 3. **EditorPage.tsx** - Improved Layout Stability
**Change:** Adjusted sticky positioning and overflow handling

```tsx
// BEFORE: Always sticky
<div className="bg-white shadow rounded-lg p-6 sticky top-6">

// AFTER: Sticky only on medium+ screens with height constraints
<div className="bg-white shadow rounded-lg p-6 md:sticky md:top-6 md:max-h-[calc(100vh-40px)] md:overflow-y-auto">
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents layout shifting on smaller screens
- Limits height to prevent viewport overflow
- Maintains scrollability within the editor panel
- No conflict with modal positioning

### 4. **EditorPage.tsx** - Container Overflow
**Change:** Added overflow control to main container

```tsx
// BEFORE:
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100">

// AFTER:
<div className="min-h-screen bg-gray-100 overflow-x-hidden">
```

**Benefits:**
- Prevents horizontal layout shifts
- Clean visual presentation

## Architecture Flow

```
EditorPage (with overflow-x-hidden)
├── Main Container (overflow controlled)
├── Left Panel (md:sticky with md:overflow-y-auto)
└── Right Panel (Resume Preview)

SkillsModal (renders via Portal to document.body)
├── Outside normal DOM flow
├── Fixed positioning at viewport level
└── No interaction with parent layout
```

## What's Fixed

✅ **No layout displacement** when Skills Modal opens
✅ **Resume preview stays in place** during skill editing
✅ **Modal properly centered** on screen
✅ **Background scroll locked** when modal is active
✅ **Responsive behavior** works on all screen sizes
✅ **Clean modal interaction** without visual glitches

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Open Skills Modal on desktop
- [ ] Open Skills Modal on tablet
- [ ] Open Skills Modal on mobile
- [ ] Add a skill while modal is open
- [ ] Remove a skill while modal is open
- [ ] Close modal and verify layout returns to normal
- [ ] Scroll editor panel while modal is closed
- [ ] Verify no horizontal scroll appears

## Technical Details

### Portal Implementation
Using React's `createPortal` ensures the modal:
- Renders at the document body level (outside React tree)
- Maintains React event handling
- Respects React's lifecycle
- Completely isolated from parent styling/positioning

### Sticky Position Constraints
- Applied only to `md:` screens (responsive)
- Set `max-height` to prevent viewport overflow
- Added internal `overflow-y-auto` for panel-level scrolling
- Doesn't interfere with fixed modals above

### Z-Index Hierarchy
```
Modal: z-50 (highest)
  ├── Modal Header: z-10 (for internal stickiness)
Editor Panel: (default stacking context)
Resume Preview: (default stacking context)
```

## Browser Compatibility
- ✅ Chrome/Edge (all versions)
- ✅ Firefox (all versions)  
- ✅ Safari (all versions)
- ✅ Mobile browsers

## Future Improvements
- Consider creating a reusable Modal component
- Implement modal stacking for multiple modals
- Add animation/transition effects
- Create global modal manager for complex interactions
