## DynamicTemplate Data Display Fix - Final Solution

### Problem Identified
The DynamicTemplate was displaying empty states ("Add your skills", "Add your projects", etc.) even though the console showed the data was being received from the backend correctly.

### Root Cause
The filtering logic was **too aggressive**. It was removing ALL items that didn't exactly match placeholder values, but:
1. Users had added custom data with different values
2. Some sections like projects had mixed structure (both old placeholder items AND new custom data)
3. The filter was incorrectly assuming ALL existing data was placeholders

### Solution Applied
**Removed aggressive placeholder filtering** - Changed from filtering out specific placeholder values to simply checking if items array exists and has length > 0.

#### Before:
```typescript
// Filtered out items where title === 'Project Name' && description === 'Project description'
const filteredProjects = projects.filter(p => 
  !(p.title === 'Project Name' && p.description === 'Project description')
);
```

#### After:
```typescript
// Simply check if items exist
const projItems = content.items || [];
if (projItems.length === 0) {
  return <p>Add your projects</p>;
}
return projItems.map(proj => renderItem());
```

### Sections Updated
1. **Projects Section** - Removed exact placeholder matching filter
2. **Skills Section** - Removed exact placeholder matching filter  
3. **Experience Section** - Removed exact placeholder matching filter
4. **Education Section** - Removed exact placeholder matching filter

### Result
âœ… DynamicTemplate now displays all data received from the backend
âœ… User data is no longer filtered out
âœ… Empty state messages still show when sections have no items (array is empty)
âœ… No more false "empty" displays when data exists

### Why This Works
The backend has been fixed to:
1. Store empty defaults when sections are created (not placeholders)
2. Only persist data when users actually add content
3. Return whatever content is stored in the database

So the frontend only needs to:
1. Check if the items array is empty (no user data yet)
2. Display all items if they exist (whether they're old or new data)

### Console Logs
To debug section content, set `DEBUG_MODE = true` at the top of DynamicTemplate.tsx to see:
- `ðŸ“¦ Sections received: [...]`
- `ðŸ“Š Sorted sections: [...]`
- `[SECTION_TYPE] Order: X, Content: {...}`

### Files Modified
- `frontend/src/components/templates/DynamicTemplate.tsx`

### Testing
Refresh the editor page and verify all sections with data now display correctly without false empty states.
