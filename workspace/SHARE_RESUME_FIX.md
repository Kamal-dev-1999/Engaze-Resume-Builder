# Share Resume Link Fix - Multi-Item Support

## Problem
The share resume link was not working after template updates. The shared resumes were blank or showing errors because:
1. ExecutiveTemplate was not imported in SharePage
2. Not all templates had the data normalization `getItemsArray()` helper
3. Different templates had different data format expectations

## Solution

### 1. Added ExecutiveTemplate to SharePage
**File:** `frontend/src/pages/SharePage.tsx`

- Added import: `import ExecutiveTemplate from '../components/templates/ExecutiveTemplate';`
- Added case for 'executive' template in the rendering logic
- Now handles all template types: modern, creative, minimalist, executive, professional

### 2. Added getItemsArray() Helper to All Templates
**Files Updated:**
- `ProfessionalTemplate.tsx`
- `ModernTemplate.tsx`
- `MinimalistTemplate.tsx`
- `CreativeTemplate.tsx`

**What it does:**
- Normalizes section content data into consistent array format
- Handles 4 different data format scenarios:
  1. Correct array format: `{ items: [...] }`
  2. Empty array with flat fields: `{ items: [], degree: "...", institution: "..." }`
  3. Mixed format: Array with placeholder + real data in flat fields
  4. Old flat object format: `{ title: "...", company: "...", ... }`

**Why it works:**
Since many resumes may have been created with different data formats, this helper ensures:
- Old resumes with flat field data still render
- New resumes with proper array format render correctly
- Mixed format data from transitions render properly
- All templates behave consistently

## What This Enables

✅ **Share links work for all templates**
- Professional
- Modern
- Creative
- Minimalist
- Executive

✅ **Data compatibility**
- Works with both old and new data formats
- No data loss during template transitions
- Backward compatible with legacy resumes

✅ **Multiple items per section**
- Can now add multiple experience entries
- Can now add multiple education entries
- Can now add multiple project entries
- (Setup completed in SectionEditor with Add/Remove buttons)

## Testing

To verify the fix:

1. **Create a resume** with ExecutiveTemplate
2. **Share it** (get the share URL)
3. **Access the share link** - should display properly
4. **Switch templates** and share again - should work for each template
5. **Add multiple entries** in experience/education/projects sections
6. **Share** - all entries should display

## Architecture

```
SharePage.tsx (accepts template_name)
    ↓
Routes to appropriate template (now includes ExecutiveTemplate)
    ↓
Template receives sections data
    ↓
getItemsArray() normalizes each section
    ↓
Renders properly formatted resume
```

## Future Improvements

- All templates now have consistent data normalization
- Ready for additional template additions
- Foundation set for dynamic template creation
